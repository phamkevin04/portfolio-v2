                    As a web technical support agent, I get the opportunity to work with different clients on their websites. 
                    Changes that are made change from simple things like hour changes on their website to fully customizing a section 
                    or page for their website. Often time, our clients would call in with bugs that need to resolve, I seek to find 
                    permanent fixes for these bugs rather than just one band-aid fix. On top of this, I maintain and hold excellent
                    communication with these clients over the phone and email to help verify their requests and also providing them
                    with other help as they need and requests. In some cases, I am able to provide our clients with different options
                    and solutions that would finalize their ideas for changes to their websites.

                    Worked with a small group of developers to create a web applicaiton that would be used by our whole organization 
                    in the United States of 1000+ youth leader members. This platform was set up with a secured login method and using
                    the database to query for each youth leader and their records. Currently, the project is still in progress, however
                    for the one year I assisted with this project, there were may demo sessions to our National Level Executive Board on
                    on the progress. The goal is to centralize a locatiton for the youth leader's database, removal of paper trail, and
                    improving processes of promotion requests. While working on the codebase, our developer team constantly worked on 
                    documentation and also creating guides on how to navigate and work around the web application for first time users.
                    Beta 1 is currently out and live for a small group of test users and feedbacks.

                    At Jacobs Engineering Group, my main job was the help with maintaining our database systems for our clients and internal company.
                    During my internship, I was given the opportunity to pick up another project as well. I helped developed a desktop application
                    that helps with the organizations of the employees and projects they were working on. This project was a project handed off from
                    another intern that left right after I joined. I worked on the code and also communicated weekly with the project requester to see
                    the progress and also get more brainstormed ideas on how the application can include more functionalities.

                    For the first few months of my internship, I was given the opportunity to work with the virtual machines and deploying
                    test modules to these servers. In the process, I was given a Powershell script to use to enchance the functionalities.
                    Our team used this script a lot however, they never had time to fix the bugs and also test different aspects of the script.
                    I was tasked to fix these bugs, make sure to have a full documentation of the script and also adding some minor functionalities.
                    Alongside with this, I also upgraded a lot of our modules from VS-2013 to VS-2015 compatability. For the second half of this internship,
                    I created an organizational project that would be used to help with internal company employees track their hours on each project, adding
                    notes and making cases for each section of the projects to be able to keep track and centralize the data.
